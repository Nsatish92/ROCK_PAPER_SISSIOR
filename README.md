# ROCK_PAPER_SISSIOR
Rock Paper Scissors is a two-player game where each player simultaneously chooses one of three hand gestures: rock (a closed fist), paper (an open hand), or scissors (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended to form a "V" shape). The winner is determined by comparing the gestures, with rock beating scissors, scissors beating paper, and paper beating rock. The game can be implemented in JavaScript using conditional statements to compare the gestures and determine the winner, and loops to allow the players to continue playing until one of them wins a certain number of rounds
